The aim of the XANESNET Project is to make the theoretical simulation of X-ray spectroscopy (XS) fast, affordable, and accessible to all researchers using deep learning. 

XS is a powerful tool with applications across the natural sciences and beyond, and the popularity of the technique is on a steep upward trajectory globally, driven by advances at, and widening access to, high-brilliance light sources such as synchrotrons and X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs). However, the high resolution of modern X-ray spectra, coupled with ever-increasing data acquisition rates, brings acutely into focus the challenge of accurately and cost-effectively analyzing these data. Decoding the dense information content of modern X-ray spectra demands detailed theoretical calculations that are capable of capturing satisfactorily the complexity of the underlying physics but that are - at the same time - fast, affordable, and accessible enough to appeal to researchers. This is a tall order but, at the XANESNET Project, we're using deep neural networks to make this a reality.
